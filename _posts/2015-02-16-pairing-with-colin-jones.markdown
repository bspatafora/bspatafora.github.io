Today I paired with Colin Jones. We were up in Libertyville, along with three of the four other members of the team.

The team met in the morning to decide on the plan for the day. Colin sketched out the part of the system that was the current primary focus so that I (and the newest team member, who was starting on the project today) could have a point of reference during the meeting and some idea of the bigger picture when jumping into the code. An IPM loomed, so a big focus of the meeting was teasing apart the tasks that could be done in parallel.

Colin moves fast, and the project is in a language whose syntax I still don’t find readily comprehensible, so I had to really focus to keep up. Given the need to finish things up for the IPM, I tried to keep a balance between asking questions when I needed to and not slowing Colin down. I was able to make a few small, implementation-level suggestions that Colin agreed with over the course of the day, which I felt good about. That kind of suggestion seems the most reasonable to make when you have very little context built up for a large, complex system.

It was really cool to see how Colin works. I’m going to try out tmux after seeing how nice it is to have your tests run in the same window as the code you’re working on. And, though it won’t be as easy to pick up, I’m going to try to debug more like Colin. When something isn’t working as I think it should, I tend to stop and think about why that might be. I’m sure Colin does this too, but he also pretty immediately starts getting a feel for the contours of what’s happening, printing things at various points in execution. In this way, you progressively shrink the areas of murky understanding and validate (or not) that the things you think you see clearly actually are the way you think they are.
