In reading *[Extreme Programming Explained][]*, I was struck by how familiar many of the values, principles, and practices Beck discusses are to me as an 8th Light apprentice.

One of the themes that came up the most is the importance of getting frequent, timely feedback about whatever it is you’re doing. This can range from practicing test-driven development to  reflecting on a half-day of pairing with a team member to spending a week implementing some stories for a customer and demoing them before starting the next one. Generating this information frequently allows you to be constantly making little adjustments to your process, making for a closer fit between what you’re doing and what is required by the current (but ever-changing) context.

A related value Beck points to is that of diversity. You can gather as much information as often as you want, but if you’re only looking at it through the lens of your own set of experiences and approaches, you won’t always interpret that information most usefully. By working with a pair partner or as part of a team, you increase the odds that someone with the appropriate background or thinking style will be there to find the source of that mysterious bug or to recommend the best solution to a design problem.

On a different note, Beck argues that it’s important for a company to act in accordance with the “humanity” of its employees. This sounds right to me—the alternative of treating employees like cogs in a machine probably isn’t a sustainable approach given the human need to feel respected and accomplished. Reading this made me appreciate even more the things 8th Light provides for its employees: A large degree of autonomy, an open work space with opportunities to engage with others, great benefits, and the bowl of fruit in the 9th floor kitchen.

I found it interesting that there were some differences in the approaches Kent Beck and 8th Light take in software development. Talking with my mentors, I realized some of them have more to do with the differences between a software development consultancy and companies that employ their own developers. Some of Beck’s advice may be specific to the latter.

But at one point Beck says that he’s never used a computer-based story tracking system (like Artisan, 8th Light’s internal story-tracking app) that could provide “a fraction of the value” of physical cards on a wall. His primary argument seems to be that picking up and rearranging the cards into groups and relative to other cards and groups has great value. It could be that none of the computer-based systems that existed at the time of writing happened to be good enough, but it made me want to try using physical cards for a project, and made me wonder what might be changed in a system like Artisan to make it a better analog of physical story-tracking systems.
