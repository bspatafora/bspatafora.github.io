Today, I paired with (or, more accurately, shadowed) Margaret Pagel, giving me a glimpse into the business side of the business and how 8th Light gets its message across to prospective clients.

I got to spend the morning listening in on a meeting involving a decision relating to the direction of the company. Probably shouldn’t get more detailed than that on a public blog. But I found it fascinating.

My experience with the company so far has been virtually exclusively in the domain of development. This is the core substance of what the company does, but there are so many other things that need to be done to enable the company to do its development work. If 8th Light isn’t growing, or isn’t generating new leads or converting those leads into clients, then the whole enterprise is at risk. It’s easy to just take the stewardship of the company for granted, but it clearly involves a ton of work and good decision-making on the part of everyone on the management team.
