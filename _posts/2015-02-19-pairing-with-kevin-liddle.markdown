I paired with Kevin Liddle today. It was one of those days when there’s something you need to figure out in order to progress but you aren’t quite sure what that thing is. In other words, there was a blocker.

The blocker related to one of a handful of JavaScript tools used in the project. One of the problems was that it wasn’t clear in which one the problem originated. Another was the relative lack of information on some of the tools.

If one of us in the room were the author of these tools, the reason for the failure would have been immediately clear. Since that wasn’t the case, we spent a good part of the day alternately fiddling with the setup based on hypotheses (though not incredibly well informed ones) and looking through the code of each of the suspect tools to try to gain a clearer picture of the problem’s context (and hopefully to generate more useful hypotheses). The problem eventually got solved in this way, though it seemed to arise more from time spent trying to better understand the components than fiddling with the setup. I’ll be keeping this in mind the next time I run into a blocker like this one.
