It’s been a few weeks since I started working on Thrill Jockey, but I’m still adjusting to and learning about working on a team. I’ve been struck throughout by how different it is from working on your own.

When I was working alone, I had my own particular rhythm—I tend to move very intentionally and slowly—and I always knew exactly what was being done because I was the only one doing it.

Being on a team, however, is completely different. You need to learn to trust your team members to do things you’d previously had total control over. This is made easier by the fact that I know I’m working with smart, skilled people, but it’s still a change. I’m hardly the only one committing to the repo, especially given that there were many people who worked on the project before any of the current team members even joined. It’s been a big adjustment to own only a small part of the codebase, and to allow your work to be guided by other people’s past decisions and current preferences.

As I settle into the rhythms of working on a team, I’m seeing more and more the benefits. Even if it’s a little unfamiliar at first, I think it’s a good thing to have to relinquish some control and trust your teammates.

One possible reason for this is that it’s necessary. Some projects are simply too large or complex for one person. But a more compelling reason is that software written by a team of people tends to be better quality software.

Just as a pair brings more experience and thinking styles to a problem than a single programmer, a team brings more minds to the table. I hope that I’ve brought some unique benefits to the project in my time on it so far, but I know that each of my team members has. There have been plenty of instances where someone has done or said something that I didn’t know anything about or that I hadn’t or wouldn’t have thought about. Each of those times has added something to the project that I, or the other teammates, might not have, and the project (and oftentimes the team) is better for it.
