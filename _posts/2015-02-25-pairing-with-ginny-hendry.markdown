Today I paired with Ginny Hendry. We worked on a project with a decent bit of difficult-to-decipher code, and spent most of our day trying to piece together an understanding of how a particular process is supposed to work so that we could change a part of it.

I’ve gotten to pair with Ginny before, on the same project. Each time, I’ve tried to absorb some of her approach to making sense of an unfamiliar system. She is very methodical, and I’ve seen it pay off again and again. Where I sometimes prematurely form assumptions about how something works or what’s going wrong, Ginny identifies the start of and then follows the causal chain until she reaches its end.

It seems to me that her ability to do this is part decision and part experience. I can be completely on-board with the approach and still not track the connections as well as Ginny does. I like pairing with her not only because it reinforced the importance of this approach, but because it gives me a chance to pick up on a few of the techniques that make her better at it.
