[The Clean Coder][] dedicates two chapters to when and how to commit to getting something done.

## Saying no

The first, “Saying No,” emphasizes the importance of *not* committing when it would not be professional to do so.

A manager will probably ask you to make some commitments as a part of their managing. Some of the commitments they ask for may be unrealistic. This is reasonable, however, because their job is to make sure whatever project you’re working on gets done, gets done quickly, and gets done cheaply. By doing this, they are simply “pursuing and defending their objectives as aggressively as they can.”

As a professional software developer, you should do the same. By pushing back when you believe a goal to be unrealistic, you are engaging honestly with the manager and your employer more broadly. While it may be uncomfortable to say no when someone tells you they need something, it is much better that they come to understand that the goal is unrealistic at the time they ask for a corresponding commitment than for them to realize with the deadline imminent.

It’s also important to look out for attempts to get you to say something that can later be construed as a commitment. A common pseudo-commitment to avoid is “I’ll try.” Not only does this suggest that your usual modus operandi is incomplete diligence, but it may also create a discrepancy in what you and the manager take away from the conversation.

## Saying yes

Instead of allowing for this sort of ambiguity, you should make sure that it’s clear when you are committing to something and when you are not. A real commitment (as opposed to a pseudo-commitment like “I’ll try”) takes the form “I will do *thing* by *time*.” A commitment like this leaves little room for ambiguity or later retraction.

If you do decide to make a commitment, you *must* fulfill that commitment. It is unprofessional to make a commitment you cannot complete.

You should only commit to having something done if you are certain you will be able to do it. This means not only that you know how to do it and have a very good sense of how long it will take, but also that you know no external factor (short of a major, unforeseen crisis) will prevent you from doing it. Such factors include other obligations and parts of the goal that depend on other people.

Finally, you should not make a commitment if it would mean compromising adherence to the disciplines of a professional software developer. This adherence is a standing commitment that supersedes all others.
