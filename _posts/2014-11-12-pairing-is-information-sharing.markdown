title:  "Pairing is information sharing"

This afternoon I had the opportunity to pair with a craftsman on a recently-started internal project, and I was really excited to do so. My apprenticeship has so far been focused on developing skills via personal projects, so I’m always grateful to have an opportunity to work alongside another person, whether they’re a student, resident, or craftsman.

The reason I enjoy pairing so much is the information sharing it entails. You and your partner will undoubtedly have different spheres of knowledge and experience. I’ve found this to be true even when working with other residents who are going through the same apprenticeship. Even when there’s overlap in your experiences, each person will have focused on different elements of those experiences, and has likely drawn different lessons from them.

In working together on the same problem, each person gets a taste of what the other person knows and how they go about their work. Depending on what it is you happen to be pairing on that day, you might get a wide sampling or a deep dive into the details of some tool, technology, or pattern your pair has accumulated experience with and knowledge of. But both carry great potential for learning and improving your own technique.

This particular pairing session was prompted by an interest in explicit information sharing—I’d been working on setting up Google OAuth in one of my projects and the next story for the internal project required the same—but I picked up a lot of information (how my pair approaches a problem, what tools he prefers, where he goes to for answers) by osmosis as well.

The most obvious information sharing is the explicit kind—when you show your pair or your pair shows you how to do something with the stated intent of teaching. But it may be that more information gets shared implicitly, or passively, throughout the time spent pairing.
