My last day of pairing was with Taka Goto. Coincidentally, where Eric and I had worked on a front-end application that depended on the proper functioning of API endpoints maintained by others, Taka and I were working on creating new endpoints for others within the company to use. It was cool to see and work on both sides of service-oriented architecture during my tour.

The scale of the system we were working on (a part of) amazed me. Its size and complexity was clear even from the vantage point of the small part of it we touched. The system as a whole is big enough and important enough to the business that there can be teams dedicated to specific domain objects in the system, and that its integrity is in part handled by quality assurance specialists.

I think this was the most enjoyable day of my pairing tour, partly because the thing we were working on was new, which meant both that we could ping-pong back and forth throughout the day and that there wasnâ€™t quite as huge a context gap. But this was also due to Taka taking the time to give me the context I did need, knowing what context to provide and when, and being able to explain things both well and concisely.
