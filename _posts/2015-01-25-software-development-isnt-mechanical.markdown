I’m reading Pete McBreen’s [*Software Craftsmanship*][]. Throughout my apprenticeship, I’ve tried to come to a better and better understanding of what it means to be a software craftsman and why craftsmanship is needed. The first few chapters of the book have provided me with a better context for understanding the second question, in large part by framing craftsmanship in contrast to the original, engineering-based approach to software development.

Software engineering evolved out of the very unusual set of requirements that defined early defense and space projects—enormous systems where hardware was developed for and before the software and where extremely low error rates were critical. McBreen discusses the SAFEGUARD missile defense system, the development of which took 5,407 staff years (over 6 real years). These days, however, the bulk of software is commercial, where projects often contain much smaller small teams and must be completed and updated more rapidly. Given this drastic shift in context, the original engineering approach should be reconsidered.

One flaw of the software engineering approach, according to McBreen, is its overemphasis on process over people. Most of the parts of development that can be automated have been. What remains is getting people onto projects that can effectively make use of these tools, combining them with their own design skill and ability to communicate with clients/users in order to progressively close the gap between the software and their needs.

McBreen argues that software development isn’t a mechanical activity, and therefore shouldn’t be defined by engineering processes that evolved to solve mechanical problems. Software development is more like designing a car than manufacturing them on an assembly line. The manufacturing process is one in which the details have already been worked out—what is left is to shape the assembly line to meet the known requirements.

The process of software development, on the other hand, involves many unknowns. The exact contours of what is needed have to be felt out during the process—they aren’t known to any level of precision beforehand. The people working on the team should therefore not only possess the technical ability to code, but also the capacity to work with others to learn more about the system and how it must change.
