Or: “I attended Windy City Rails and all I got was this big bag of humble.”

Actually, I got a ton out of attending. I wormed my way into some interesting conversations, and there were a number of really excellent, insightful talks. I’m planning on writing a blog post on at least one of them (“Let’s do some upfront design”—on building a system with modularity in mind from the start), but I want to wait until the videos are available since I wasn’t able to take notes or devote my full attention since I was in charge of making sure the camera didn’t tip over.

But the biggest benefit was the visceral reminder of just how little I know.

This is despite feeling that I’ve been filling my brain to capacity every day of my apprenticeship. I’m trying to integrate so much information that I end up near mental exhaustion the end of each week. It’s also despite having known full well how little I still know before going into the conference.

There’s a difference between knowing something and really *feeling* it, though, and this conference made me feel it.

And I think that’s a good thing. It’s good to be humble. Humility keeps you open-minded and it makes you eager to learn, since it means you you know (or at least have some sense of) how much you don’t know.
